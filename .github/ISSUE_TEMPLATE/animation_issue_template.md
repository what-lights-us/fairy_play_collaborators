As you work on this shot, there are a number of times you'll be expected to check-in and 
have your work reviewed for style and accuracy. The following bullet align with the 
phases of the project board

1. [ ] **Acquire Acting Reference:** Work with the lead animator to affirm that you have 
			 appropriate reference for your shot prior to key posing
2. [ ] **Keyframing:** Once your initial key frames are set, check-in for a first round 
			 round of review
3. [ ] **Initial Polish:** After your first round of polishing, you'll check-in for 
			 detailed notes.
4. [ ] **Final Polish:** At this point, you'll be turning in your shots for lighting 
			 and you can transition to a new shot.  Work with the lead animator to decide what 
			 shot to take next
