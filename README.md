# Fairy Play Collaborators
Welcome to the Fairy Play project! This repository exists to provide instructions
for how to interact with the GitHub project and to outline the basic way that work 
will be assigned, checked in, and reviewed.  Under the `Projects` tab above,
you will find project boards with tasks outlining work that needs to be done.
GitHub Issues, while great for software developers, can leave a little to be desired
for artists.
The [Issue Previewer](https://github.com/what-lights-us/github_issue_image_previewer)
browser extension makes it a little easier to see the details of the tickets on the
project boards and it is recommended you install it, but not required.

In each board, there are tickets for work to be done.  After reviewing those that are
currently sitting in `Todo`, reach out on the appropriate Discord channel to request the
ticket.  Once assigned, the lead overseeing that department will add your name to the
ticket and move it from `Todo` to some type of "In Progress" state. The department lead
will be your primary point of contact regarding questions about style and to have your
work reviewed for submission; similarly, the department lead will set expectations for
deadlines and check-ins.  As you meet the various check-ins, they'll be advancing your
ticket towards `Done`.
